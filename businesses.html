                    <h2>Tea Businesses in Darjeeling</h2>
                    <p>The tea business in Darjeeling is an integral part of the local economy, with a rich history dating back to the mid-19th century when British colonizers first began experimenting with tea cultivation in the area.
                         Today, there are over 80 tea estates and gardens in the region, known for producing high-quality teas with a unique flavor profile that is floral and musky. Tea production takes place from March to November, with the peak harvest season in May and June.
                          Darjeeling tea has been granted Geographical Indication (GI) status, protecting its identity and quality, and is a popular export product, with buyers in countries such as Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. However, the industry faces several challenges, including climate change, labor shortages, competition from other tea-producing regions, and political unrest that has disrupted production and caused financial losses.
                           Nonetheless, Darjeeling tea remains a highly sought-after product, with a growing demand for organic and fair-trade varieties.</p>
                    <h3>Here are a few businesses that are well-known for their quality service : </h3>
