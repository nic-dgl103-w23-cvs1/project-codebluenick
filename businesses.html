                <h2>Tea Businesses in Darjeeling</h2>
                <p>The tea business in Darjeeling is an integral part of the local economy, with a rich history dating
                    back to the mid-19th century when British colonizers first began experimenting with tea cultivation
                    in the area.
                    Today, there are over 80 tea estates and gardens in the region, known for producing high-quality
                    teas with a unique flavor profile that is floral and musky. Tea production takes place from March to
                    November, with the peak harvest season in May and June.
                    Darjeeling tea has been granted Geographical Indication (GI) status, protecting its identity and
                    quality, and is a popular export product, with buyers in countries such as Japan, the United States,
                    and the United Kingdom. However, the industry faces several challenges, including climate change,
                    labor shortages, competition from other tea-producing regions, and political unrest that has
                    disrupted production and caused financial losses.
                    Nonetheless, Darjeeling tea remains a highly sought-after product, with a growing demand for organic
                    and fair-trade varieties.</p>
