            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first tea gardens in Darjeeling were established in the mid-19th century by British planters who were seeking to replicate the success of tea cultivation in other parts of India.
                 The cool climate and high altitude of the Darjeeling region made it an ideal location for growing tea, and soon the region became famous for its high-quality tea.</p>
            <p>In the early years, Darjeeling tea was primarily sold to British consumers, who prized its unique flavor and aroma. 
                However, over time, the tea became popular in other parts of the world as well, and today it is enjoyed by tea lovers all over the globe.</p>
            <p>Today, Darjeeling tea is protected by a geographical indication (GI) status, which means that only tea grown in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal can be sold as Darjeeling tea. 
                This helps to protect the quality and reputation of the tea, and ensures that consumers are getting an authentic product.</p>
